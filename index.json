Desirably the narration sould be free of any commitment to any person(s), that is refrain from the use of pronouns such as I, We, Our, Us, etc.\nTo convey understanding, the organization of the lab report should lead to a deft arrangment of information including data, graphs, and pertinent answes to such questions posed by the experiments.\nThe preferred lab report format is typewritten, double-space. thus for this course the guideline for an acceptable lab report format is outlined in the following example  Lab Report Ouline  Behavior of Material, Structural Members and Equilibrium Lab Report Submission: Student are required to submit an individual lab report for the each experiment. PDFs are the preferred format since PDFs can be uploaded to Blackboard.\n Assignment 1 : Fatigue Failure Assignment 2 : Tension \u0026amp; Compression Test Assignment 3 : Bending of Beam \u0026amp; Moments of Forces Assignment 4 : Internal Forces in Truss Members \u0026amp; End Reaction of a loaded Beam  Make sure you write a separate lab report for each experiment.\n Lab experiments Resources and Instructions:    Experiment Manual Data Resources     Fatigue Failure Handout   Get Data   Watch   Tension Test Handout   Get Data   Demo\u0026ndash; Virtual Tensile Tester   Compression Test Handout   Get Data   Eulers Equation \u0026ndash; Backling Example   Bending of Beam Handout   Get Data   Demo - Virtual lab Demo   Moments of Forces Handout   Get Data   Using Interactive   End Reaction of a Loaded Beam Handout   Get Data   Beam Calculator   Interenal Forces in Truss Members Handout   Get Data   Setup and Instruction Manual- Truss Simulator - Equilibrium    **Values of modulus of elasticity: **\n   Material E value in [Pa] E value in [psi]     Rubber $$1.72\\times 10^6$$ $$250$$   Aluminum $$70\\times 10^9$$ $$10\\times 10^6$$   Wood $$15\\times 10^9$$ $$2\\times 10^6$$   Ruler $$2.8\\times 10^9$$ $$400\\times 10^3$$    Engineering Design Project : Design \u0026amp; Analysis of a Warren Truss Bridge The last section demonstrated the use of powerful tool for analyzing civil engineering structures where the program was used to perform static analysis of truss. The SAP2000 program is also capable of analyzing frames plates and shell for static as well as dynamic loads. In this section, its application will be extended to the analysis of a simple truss bridge.\nSAP2000 Software\nPlease follow these steps to download, install, and activate your software.\n Download  SAP2000 Installation file   Run the installation. Click here to request an activation key When prompted to activate a license, use the activation key to activate.  Introductory Tutorial for SAP2000 The manual provided bellow will introduces you to SAP2000. The step-by-step instructions guide you through development of your first model. The intent is to demonstrate the fundamentals and to show how quickly and easily a model can be created using the program. Completing the tutorial will give you hands-on experience working with SAP2000, which for most people is the quickest way to become familiar with the program.\n Download SAP2000 Tutorial  Design and Analysis Of a WARREN Truss Bridge Perform the structural analysis of a steel truss bridge that spans a total distance of 63 ft. The truss bridge consists of two parallel trusses and the truss configuration is given in the figure below. The lower chords of the trusses support the roadway which in turn carries the car and truck traffic. The object of this analysis is to calculate the internal forces in each member of the bridge under the effect of the weight of the bridge and roadway (the dead load) and the weight of the vehicles (the live loads) that are likely to cross the bridge. It is here in assumed that the bridge carries two lanes of vehicle traffic. Make a first estimate of the internal forces in each truss member under regular truck traffic. The analysis must be performed using the SAP2000 package. Use the simplifying assumptions given below to analyze the four-bay Warren truss bridge shown in Fig 1.\nBridge Preliminary design On SAP2000  WARREN Truss bridge step by step design instructions  Download pdf file   Watch Demo video here  Bridge Analysis, and Assessement of Results STEP 1: Calculate the areas required for each member\nUse MS-Excel to calculate the areas required for each member to carry the force produced by different loading condition considered. Recall that the analysis of the truss bridge was performed by assuming that each member had an area equal to 20in^2. To find the area required for each member to support the loading conditions, we assumed that A36 structural steel was used with a design safety factor of 1.5. the maximum possible stress is 36,000 psi for A36 steel. Therefore the allowable stress is obtained as :\n$$\\sigma_{all} = \\frac{\\sigma_{max}}{S.F} = \\frac{36,000 psi}{1.5} = 24,000 psi$$\nif the force in a member is given as F and the area is given as A, the stress in the member is $${{{\\sigma}}} = \\frac{F}{A}$$\nif the stress is set at a value equal to the allowable stress, The minimum required area for the steel member is solve as\n$$A_{min} = \\frac{F}{{\\sigma}_{all}}$$\nAs a first step in the design process. follow the summary table below:\n   Member Number Combination Force (DSTL4) $$A_{min} = \\frac{Force}{{\\sigma}_{all}}$$ $$ A_{required} = A_{min} + margin$$     1      2      \u0026hellip;       $$DSTL4 = (All\\space Live\\space Loads) + (Dead\\space Loads)$$\nThe following video demonstrate how to find DSTL4 forces.\nNote : the margin is an estimated number that needs to be added in order to find the final area that must be used for each member, and that is the largest area obtained for that member for the different loading conditions considered.\n STEP 2: Assign the new required areas to the bridge steel members\n• Go to the Steel Sections website and select the proper cross section area (e.g. W10x68 for 20in^2) calculated in the previous section. • In SAP2000 select a member that you want to change the cross section then follow step 3 in the tutorial to assign it. • Check the safety of a design again and make sure your member is optimum in terms of cost and not overstressed (green Color)\nThe following video demonstrate how to assign a cross section and check the safety of design.\n STEP 3: Cost analysis\nAfter finding the area required for each member, use this excel file template to calculate the volume V of each member. the volume is given by :\n$$V = A.L$$\nWhere A is cross sectional area of the member and L is the length of member. After finding the volume calculate the weight of each element using the specific weigth of steel.\n Steel cost $560 per ton Concrete cost $50 per cubic yard Calculate only the material cost for the steel members and roadway (neglect connections and Labor costs)  "

	"content": "Introduction to Thermodynamics for Technicians EXPERIMENT 1: CHARLES’ LAW Introduction : Charles’ Law states that at a constant pressure, the volume of a fixed mass or quantity of gas varies directly with the absolute temperature.\n$$V =$$ $$c\\times T$$\nIn the formula, V is volume, T is absolute temperature measured in Kelvin, and c is a constant.\nSimulator Setup and Data Collection  Launch the simulator. Click HERE. Reset the pressure to zero using the red valve under the pressure gage Reset the temperature by pressing the “Cool” until the temperature reads 10 K then press “OFF” when done. Select Gas A or Gas B. The gas of choice will be in CAPS. Push the piston three times to increase the pressure Increase the temperature by clicking “Heat” at about 500K then click “Heat” again to stop the heating. Record in the Table 1 below, the Pressure, Temperature and Volume Press “Cool” to decrease the temperature and record four more temperature and corresponding volume in the Table 1 below.  Press “Cool” to stop the cooling and get a fixed temperature reading.\n Stop recording data when you get five data points in the table.  Table 1: Experimental Data\n   Pressure - FIXED [atm] Temperature [K] Volume [l]                      Calculations and Analysis  Calculate and record the volume in m3. Draw the graph of temperature (on y-axis) versus volume (on x-axis) Determine whether the slope of the plot of temperature versus volume is linear.  Question\nHow well does your graph of temperature versus volume support the idea that volume of a gas at constant pressure is directly proportional to the absolute temperature of the gas?\nEXPERIMENT 2: BOYLE’S LAW  Introduction  Boyle’s Law states that the product of the volume of a gas times its pressure is a constant at a fixed temperature.\n$$P\\times V$$ = $$k$$\nwhere k is a constant.\nTherefore, at a fixed temperature, the pressure will be inversely proportional to the volume. As pressure increases, volume decreases. The relationship shown below shows that a plot of pressure versus the reciprocal of the volume will be linear.\n$$P=$$ $$\\frac{k}{V}$$\nwhere k is a constant.\nSimulator Setup and Data Collection  Launch the simulator. Click HERE. Reset the pressure to zero using the red valve under the pressure gage Reset the temperature by pressing the “Cool” until the temperature reads 10 K then press “OFF” when done. Select Gas A or Gas B. The gas of choice will be in CAPS. Increase the temperature by clicking “Heat” at about 400K then click “Heat” again to stop the heating. Push the piston three times to increase the pressure Record in the Table 2 below, the Temperature, Volume and Pressure Press the down arrow to decrease the volume and record four more volume and corresponding pressure in the Table 2 below.  Press the down arrow to stop the decrease in volume and get a fixed volume reading.\n Stop recording data when you get five data points in the Table 2 .  "
